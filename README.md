# English-to-Spanish-Translation-Using-LSTM-Neural-Machine-Translation-
This project is a simple sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural machine translation model built using TensorFlow. It translates English sentences into Spanish using LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture. The dataset used is the spa-eng parallel corpus, which consists of thousands of sentence pairs.
